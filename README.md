# Lanraragi React Web

A react based front-end application for making use of the Lanraragi api. Works best on mobile and tablet viewports, but the desktop experience is okay.

## Features

- The app makes use of the Client API to interact with LANraragi and get access to things like archive, thumbnails, images, categories, etc.

- Read archives (only tested .cbz/.zip files, other supported LRR file formats need testing) from your favorite web browsers on any device.
